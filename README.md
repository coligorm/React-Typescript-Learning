# Learning React Using TypeScript

Currently following the [LinkedIn Learning Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-using-typescript-23743818?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlearningCollection%3A7315539718224445441)
The **key learning points** for me are:
 - **Structured Development:** Combining TypeScript with React provides a more structured approach to JavaScript application development, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
 - **Types and Components:** You'll learn about basic and complex types, as well as functional and stateful components in React.
 - **Interfaces and Best Practices:** The course covers how to use TypeScript interfaces to improve your React code and reviews best practices.
 - **Higher-Order Components:** Learn to implement higher-order components to reuse components while adding new functionality.
